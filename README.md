Arrow
=====
Arrow is a Tetris-like brick puzzle game, a free PC clone of GuruGuru - a preinstalled Java game on Pantech PG-1500 cellphones.

Unlike original Tetris, here you have to build lines of 3 arrow bricks that point in the same direction, rather than filling rows. There are four one-direction arrows (left, right, up, down), two bi-directional (horizontal and vertical), and one omni-directional. When a line is built, it disappears, and neighbour arrows rotate clockwise. 

Currently the game is endless and has no levels or score nor any other challenge system (thought you can fill the board and get "Game Over" screen).

System requrements
------------------
 * Windows (precompiled binary exists for Win32) or Linux (build yourself);
 * 128 Mb of memory;
 * Any graphics card that supports OpenGL 1.1 or higher. 

Arrow should run on virtually any hardware, even on very outdated machines.

Controls
--------
 * Left/Right = move active piece left or right;
 * Down = drop active piece;
 * Spacebar = rotate active piece;
 * Enter = pause the game;
 * Escape = exit the game.
