 Y combinator
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We're all familiar with the idea of a function as something that takes some 
 input value and returns some output value. Say, the function for squaring numbers:

   f(x) = x*x;

 The fixed points of a function are any input values for which f(x) is equal to x. 
 So, the fixed points of f(x) = x*x are 0 and 1.

 Now, we have things called higher-order functions. These are functions that take another 
 function as input, or return a function as output, or both. 

 The fixed point of a higher-order function f is another function p such that f(p) = p. 
 It may be more helpful to think in terms of functions actually being executed. 
 The previous statement is equivalent to the statement that f(p)(x) = p(x) for all values of x.

 Y (the Y combinator) is a special function that returns the fixed points of higher-order 
 functions, that is to say:

   f(Y(f)) = Y(f)

 Y combinator is commonly use to allow anonymous recursion without assuming your host 
 language supports it.
